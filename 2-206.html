                <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>My husband had a dream which was he climbed a mountain with his friands. They suddenly noticed, while half way up the mountain, that the sky covered by volcanic ashes from the top of the mountain. This is an active volcano and seems like it spews out in any minute. My husband sprang away, sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him, rushed into the hotel they stayed, grabbed everything belongs to him, concealed himself to safety underground. And then, he checked up his belongings, having a plentiful supply of double goods, especially a pair of bowl and chopsticks. Everything’s under control but my wife. Where is my wife? I lost my wife? Did I hold her hand or not? My husband got a terrible shock in his dream. He thought if I didn’t hold her hand then she would not be able to escap. He asked everyone entered here if anyone saw his wife. The answer is no. He painted a picture in his head that his wife was terrified and stood still with her mouth opened wildly, swallowed up by the volcanic ashes.</p>
<p>This morning my husband laughed and told me about his strange dream. He said that even though he’s worried to death, but still got lucky didn’t dragged me running with him, because it would be killed both of us by your slow reactions.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I’m not my husband’s wife yet, he took me to a restaurant. During the dinner, a gas tand under the table suddenly started a fire. He jumped up from his seat and quickly hid behind the door. I was terrified and seated still with my mouth opened wildly by the table utill a waiter shouted at me to leave the fire.(Yep, it is the picture my husband dreamed of.) After that he explained that is his reflex movement. First reaction is keep himself remote from danger. The head didn’t think, the body had moved.</p>
<p>Last year, I followed my husband to attend a IT conference in ShangHai. In the subway, he’s out but I was stuck with people stepped in while the subway’s door half closed. I was terrified and stood still with my mouth opened wildly.( I’m pretty sure that looks impressed him deeply). He immediately turned around, rushed toward me, pressed his arms against the door, and pulled me out. After that he explained that is his reflex movement. First reaction is keep his wife remote from danger. The head didn’t think, the body had moved.</p>
<p>Later he said, you are silly enough. If you shut your head in the subway door, that may cause more brain damage. I can’t take more silly you anymore.</p>
<p>I knew he’s joking with me and I actually enjoy it.</p>
